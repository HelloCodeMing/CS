# CS
A toy-like shell, using c++ syntax. Only support part of characteristics.

I wrote this project just for fun, please don't use it in real work.

# Show
It works like a shell: once you type in a sentence, the CS could evaluate it and print the result.
```
Welcome to CS!
CS: **int a**;
res: a = 0
CS: **a = 1 + 1**;
res: a = 2
CS: **println(a)**;
2
res: 
CS: exit
```
